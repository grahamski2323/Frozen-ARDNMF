# Frozen-ARDNMF
For CMSC 828P  Final Project Code Submission

demo_GA_frozen is a script to run L2 and L1 implementations of Frozen ARDNMF

ardnmf_L1/L2_frozen are the modifed frozen algorithms.

To toggle between beta values (currently set to 1, KL-divergence), type of regularization, or any other hyperparameters, alter lines 21-26 of the demo file.

Note that this code has not been optiimized for efficiency, however, code usually runs in less an two minutes for L2 regularization and less than a minute (Wall Time) for L1.
